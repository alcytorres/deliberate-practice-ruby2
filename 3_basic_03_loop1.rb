# Write a loop which modifies a variable each time the loop runs

# 1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

# # Solution
# num = 1
# while num <= 10
#   puts num
#   num += 1
# end

# # Solution
# (1..10).each {|num| puts num}

# # Solution
# (1..10).each do |num|  # Iterate over the range from 1 to 10.
#   puts num            # Print each number.
# end

# # Solution
# def counter(num)            # Define a method 'counter' that takes one argument, 'num'
#   numbers = []              # Initialize an empty array 'numbers' to store the sequence of numbers

#   while num <= 10           # Start a loop that continues as long as 'num' is less than or equal to 10
#     numbers << num          # Append the current value of 'num' to the 'numbers' array
#     num += 1                # Increment 'num' by 1 for the next iteration
#   end                       # End of the while loop

#   numbers                   # Return the array of numbers after the loop finishes
# end                         # End of the 'counter' method definition

# number = 1                  # Assign the value 1 to the variable 'number'
# p counter(number)           # Call the 'counter' method with 'number' as argument and print the returned array

# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Ruby while Loop Return Values
    # Control Structure: while loops are for control flow, not value computation.
    # Default Return: When a while loop ends naturally, it returns nilâ€”not the last evaluated value.
    # Explicit Return: To use a computed value from the loop, return it explicitly after the loop or use break with a value.

# Example
# num = 1
# result = while num <= 3
#            puts num
#            num += 1
#          end
# puts "The while loop returned: #{result.inspect}"

# Although the loop printed numbers from 1 to 3,
# the variable 'result' will be nil because a while loop returns nil when it finishes naturally.

# 2. Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

# # Solution
# i = 1
# while i <= 5
#   puts "hello"
#   i += 1
# end

# # Solution
# (1..5).each do |i|
#   if i <= 5
#     puts "hello"
#   end
# end


# 3. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".
# #    REVIEW


# Solution
# while true                  # Start an infinite loop. This loop will keep running until a 'break' is encountered.
#   puts "Enter a word"       # Prompt the user to enter a word
#   user_input = gets.chomp   # Read input from the user and remove the trailing newline
#   if user_input == "stop"   # Check if the user input is "stop"
#     break                   # If the input is "stop", exit the loop immediately.
#   end                       # If the input isn't "stop", the loop will continue and prompt again.
# end


# 4. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

# Solution
# num = 0
# while num <= 100
#   puts num
#   num += 5
# end


# 5. Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

# Solution
# index = 1
# while index <= 10
#   puts 9000
#   index += 1
# end


# 6. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

# Solution
# while true                 # Begin an infinite loop
#   puts "Enter a number: "  # Prompt the user to enter a number
#   input = gets.chomp       # Read user input and remove the newline character
#   if input.to_i > 10       # Convert the input to an integer and check if it's greater than 10
#     break                  # Exit the loop if the condition is met
#   end
# end


# The .to_i method is required because gets returns a string. Converting the string to an integer with .to_i allows you to perform a numeric comparison (i.e., check if the number is greater than 10).


# 7. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

# Solution
# num = 50
# while num <= 70
#   puts num
#   num += 1
# end


# 8. Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

# Solution
# index = 1
# while index <= 144
#   puts "Around the world"
#   index += 1
# end


# 9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

# Solution
# while true
#   puts "Enter a word"
#   input = gets.chomp
#   if input.length > 5
#     break
#   end
# end


# 10. Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.

# Solution
# num = 2
# while num <= 40
#   puts num
#   num += 2
# end
