# Write number and string variables with built-in methods

#1. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints that number plus 10.

number = 7
puts number + 10

#2. Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

word = "sky"
puts word.upcase

#3. Write a program that uses variables to store two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

number1 = 4
number2 = 10
puts number1 + number2

# 4. Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

word = "sky"
puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints the number times 10.

number = 7
p number * 10

# 6. Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

word1 = "sky"
word2 = "ocean"
puts word1.upcase + " " + word2.upcase

# puts "#{word1.upcase} #{word2.upcase}"

# 7. Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

word = "breaking"
puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that uses a variable to store a number with decimals, then prints the number as an integer.

number = 3.141
puts number.to_i

# puts number.to_f

# 9. Write a program that uses a variable to store two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

num1 = 3
num2 = 5
puts num1 * num2

# 10. Write a program that uses a variable to store a word, then prints the word with all lowercase letters.

word = "SKY"
p word.downcase
