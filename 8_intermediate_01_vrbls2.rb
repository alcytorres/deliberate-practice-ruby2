# Insert a variable into a string using either concatenation or interpolation



# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"

puts first_name + " " + last_name 

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
first_name = "Mark"
last_name = "Smith"
puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# puts "What is your name?"
# user_input = gets.chomp
# if user_input == "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
color1 = "blue"
color2 = "white"
color3 = "black"
puts "The three colors are" + " " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", " + "and " + color3 + "."


# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).


# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# puts "What is your name?"
# user_input = gets.chomp
# if user_input != "Santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).


# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).



# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
puts "Enter a password"
user_input = gets.chomp
if user_input == "Joshua"
  puts "Shall we play a game?"
else
  puts "Access denied"
end




# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
